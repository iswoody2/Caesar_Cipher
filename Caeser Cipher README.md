Caesar Cipher Project

üìú Project Purpose
This project implements a Caesar Cipher ‚Äî a classic encryption technique used in cryptography, where each letter in the text is shifted a certain number of places in the alphabet. This Python program allows users to encode or decode messages by specifying the shift amount, making it an interactive way to learn about one of the simplest forms of encryption.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for this project.
Python Libraries:
art: Used for displaying the ASCII art logo.
Standard Python functions and constructs such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists.


üîç Features
Encoding and Decoding: Users can choose to either encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt) a message.
Shift Control: Customizable shift amount allows users to control how far each letter is shifted.
Character Handling: Supports letters, while ignoring numbers, spaces, and special characters, allowing users to enter complex messages without losing non-alphabet characters.
Looped Interaction: Users are prompted to encode or decode multiple messages until they decide to exit.


üí° Impact
The Caesar Cipher project is a straightforward yet effective way to understand the basics of encryption. It provides hands-on practice with fundamental programming concepts such as:

Conditionals and Loops: Using while loops and if statements to control program flow and interact with users.
Modular Code: Encapsulating logic in functions, promoting code reuse and readability.
User Interaction: Implementing a simple text-based interface for user input and interaction.
By working on this project, users gain an introductory understanding of encryption while reinforcing Python skills.
